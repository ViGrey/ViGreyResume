### Description:

This is my personal resume.  It is simultaneously a valid PDF, HTML, Python (2 & 3 compatible), Brainfu--, and ZIP file.  Unzipping ViGreyResume.pdf will result in the source code of ViGreyResume.pdf, which can be used to build ViGreyResume.pdf, which will be a PDF/HTML/Python/Brainfu--, ZIP polyglot file.

### Platforms:

    Prints an ASCII version of the resume if no options are provided

    Options:
      -b, --bf BF_FILE_PATH   Interpret BF_FILE_PATH as a Brainfu-- Program
      -h, --help              Print Help (this message) and exit

    Examples:
      python3 ViGreyResume.pdf
      python3 ViGreyResume.pdf --bf ViGreyResume.pdf
      python3 ViGreyResume.pdf -b ViGreyResume.pdf
      python3 ViGreyResume.pdf --help
      python3 ViGreyResume.pdf -h

### Running ViGreyResume.pdf as a Python 3 File:
